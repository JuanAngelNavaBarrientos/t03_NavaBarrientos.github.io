        <h2>ü§î Why?</h2>
        <p>
          It's the first thing I remember playing. When I was 4 or 5 years old the first LEGO games came out and I had a lot of fun, although I didn't really follow the story. Already a little older, I saw the movies and I liked them a lot. The series "The clone wars" came out and I liked it, although the same episodes always happened.
          I feel that it is a series with many setbacks, with few really good films; but in the end it is a very pure story, almost a tale, that presents us with different concepts (some very clich√©d) and a lot of creativity when designing the worlds, vehicles and characters.        </p>
